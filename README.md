# Simple E-commerce Project

This is a study project aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of Next.js and its fundamentals. The project incorporates other technologies such as:

- Firebase
- Zustand
- TypeScript

The primary emphasis of this project was on learning and applying Next.js fundamentals. Please note that I did not prioritize CSS and responsiveness, so there is currently no mobile version available for this application.

## Getting Started

To test the project, you can clone it using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LucasFagundes098/nextjs-ecommerce
```

Or download the repository and use npm to install all the required packages and dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result.
